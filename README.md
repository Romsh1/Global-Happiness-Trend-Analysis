# 🌍 Global Happiness Trend Analysis (2015–2023)

This project explores global happiness trends over time using the **World Happiness Report datasets** from 2015 to 2023. By analyzing and visualizing key factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and more, the project aims to uncover patterns and insights that influence happiness across countries and continents.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- 📊 Combine and clean multiple years of World Happiness data
- 🧹 Standardize columns across datasets for consistency
- 🔍 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify global and regional trends
- 🗺️ Visualize changes in happiness over time using interactive and static plots
- 💡 Derive insights about the key drivers of happiness
- 🧠 (Optional) Build a predictive model to estimate happiness scores based on key indicators

## 🧾 Data Source

- 📁 [World Happiness Report Datasets (2015–2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report)
- 📄 Official source: [https://worldhappiness.report](https://worldhappiness.report)

Each year contains a CSV file with rankings and scores based on:
- GDP per capita
- Social support
- Healthy life expectancy
- Freedom to make life choices
- Generosity
- Perceptions of corruption

## 🧪 Work in Progress

This project is currently under development.  
🚧 Tasks in progress:

- [x] Collect datasets from 2015 to 2023
- [x] Clean and standardize data structure
- [ ] Merge all datasets into a single DataFrame
- [ ] Conduct EDA and visualizations
- [ ] Create interactive visuals (e.g. time-series, heatmaps)
- [ ] Build and evaluate optional prediction model
- [ ] Document insights and findings
- [ ] Finalize and polish the `README.md`

## 📈 Sample Questions To Explore

- How has global happiness changed over the past decade?
- Which regions are consistently ranked happiest?
- What are the strongest correlating factors with happiness scores?
- How does happiness vary by GDP or life expectancy?
- Has any country shown consistent improvement or decline?

## 📷 Visuals (Coming Soon)

<!-- Will include graphs, charts, and maps here after EDA -->
